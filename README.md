# Python-Movie-Analyzer
This project's aim was to create a Python script that scraped movie descriptions from IMDB and break down the most frequently used words per movie. It accepts a list of words to exclude as input (such as comas, full stops, the's, etc) and then presents the processed words as a barplot for visualisation purposes.
Note that only the top 20 words appear on the barplot to try and from a corelation between movie type and words most used.
